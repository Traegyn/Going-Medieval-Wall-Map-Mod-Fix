Always back up your game files before editing them directly. 

I have only tested this on the Going Medieval Experimental Branch.

I am subscribed to the mod via Steam and have it activated in the game via the Mod Menu. 

Copy the JSON files into their respective folders and overwrite the files present of the same name.
